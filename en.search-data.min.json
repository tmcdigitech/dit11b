A project folder is a directory/folder on your computer that contains the main program (main.py) and other optional scripts or files. This project folder and all of its contents will be copied to the EV3 Brick, where the main program will be run.\nThis page shows you how to create such a project and how to transfer it to the EV3 Brick.\n Figure 8: A project contains a program called main.py and optional resources like sounds or MicroPython modules.   Creating a new project    To create a new project, open the EV3 MicroPython tab and click create a new project, as shown in Figure 9. Enter a project name in the text field that appears and press Enter. When prompted, choose a location for this program and confirm by clicking choose folder.\n Figure 9: Creating a new project. This example is called getting_started, but you can choose any name.   When you create a new project, it already includes a file called main.py. To see its contents and to modify it, open it from the file browser as shown in Figure 10. This is where you’ll write your programs.\nIf you are new to MicroPython programming, we recommend that you keep the existing code in place and add your code to it.\n Figure 10: Opening the default main.py program.   Opening an existing project    To open a project you created previously, click File and click Open Folder, as shown in Figure 11. Next, navigate to your previously created project folder and click OK. You can also open your recently used projects using the Open Recent menu option.\n Figure 11: Opening a previously created project.   Connecting to the EV3 Brick with Visual Studio Code    To be able to transfer your code to the EV3 Brick, you’ll first need to connect the EV3 Brick to your computer with the mini-USB cable and configure the connection with Visual Studio Code. To do so:\n Turn the EV3 Brick on Connect the EV3 Brick to your computer with the mini-USB cable Configure the USB connection as shown in Figure 12.   Figure 12: Configuring the USB connection between the computer and the EV3 Brick   Downloading and running a program    You can press the F5 key to run the program. Alternatively, you can start it manually by going to the debug tab and clicking the green start arrow, as shown in Figure 13.\nWhen the program starts, a pop-up toolbar allows you to stop the program if necessary. You can also stop the program at any time using the back button on the EV3 Brick.\nIf your program produces any output with the print command, this is shown in the output window.\n Figure 13: Running a program   Expanding the example program    Now that you’ve run the basic code template, you can expand the program to make a motor move. First, attach a Large Motor to Port B on the EV3 Brick, as shown in Figure 14.\n Figure 14: The EV3 Brick with a Large Motor attached to port B.   Next, edit main.py to make it look like this:\n#!/usr/bin/env pybricks-micropython from pybricks.hubs import EV3Brick from pybricks.ev3devices import Motor from pybricks.parameters import Port # Create your objects here # Initialize the EV3 Brick. ev3 = EV3Brick() # Initialize a motor at port B. test_motor = Motor(Port.B) # Write your program here # Play a sound. ev3.speaker.beep() # Run the motor up to 500 degrees per second. To a target angle of 90 degrees. test_motor.run_target(500, 90) # Play another beep sound. ev3.speaker.beep(frequency=1000, duration=500) This program makes your robot beep, rotate the motor, and beep again with a higher pitched tone. Run the program to make sure that it works as expected.\nManaging files on the EV3 Brick    After you’ve downloaded a project to the EV3 Brick, you can run, delete, or back up programs stored on it using the device browser as shown in Figure 15.\n Figure 15: Using the EV3 device browser to manage files on your EV3 Brick   "},{"id":12,"href":"/dit11/gameDesign/03walkthroughs/tankGame/","title":"Tanks","parent":"Walk-throughs","content":" Battle City 1985 Tank Moving the tank Background and Walls Randomizing the Walls Blocking Movements Tank Cannon Destroying Walls One Enemy Enemy Bullets Many Enemies Winning and Losing  "},{"id":13,"href":"/dit11/gameDesign/03walkthroughs/","title":"Walk-throughs","parent":"Game Design","content":""},{"id":14,"href":"/dit11/gameDesign/03walkthroughs/chaseGame/","title":"Chase game","parent":"Walk-throughs","content":"Chase game\n"},{"id":15,"href":"/dit11/gameDesign/03walkthroughs/mazeGame/","title":"Maze game","parent":"Walk-throughs","content":"Maze game\nIntroduces tile maps\n"},{"id":16,"href":"/dit11/gameDesign/03walkthroughs/shootingGame/","title":"Shooting game","parent":"Walk-throughs","content":"Shooting game\n"},{"id":17,"href":"/dit11/gameDesign/03walkthroughs/racingGame/","title":"Racing game","parent":"Walk-throughs","content":"Racing game\n"},{"id":18,"href":"/dit11/appdev/gettingStarted/flowcharts/","title":"Flowcharts","parent":"Getting Started","content":"Flowcharts are a visual representation of program flow. A flowchart normally uses a combination of blocks and arrows to represent actions and sequence. Blocks typically represent actions. The order in which actions occur is shown using arrows that point from statement to statement. Sometimes a block will have multiple arrows coming out of it, representing a step where a decision must be made about which path to follow.\n Start and End symbols are represented as rounded rectangles, usually containing the word \u0026ldquo;Star\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;End\u0026rdquo;, but can be more specific such as \u0026ldquo;Power Robot Off\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Stop All Motors\u0026rdquo;.\nActions are represented as rectangles and act as basic commands. Examples: wait(10) increment LineCount by 1 motors full ahead\nDecision blocks are represented as diamonds. These typically contain Yes/No questions. Decision blocks have two or more arrows coming Out Of them, representing the different paths that can be followed, depending on the outcome Of the decision. The arrows should always be labelled accordingly.\n  Example Flowchart    The following flowchart instructs a robot to run forward as long as its touch sensor is not pressed. When the touch sensor is pressed the motors stop and the program ends.

"},{"id":19,"href":"/dit11/appdev/gettingStarted/constructs/","title":"Programming Constructs","parent":"Getting Started","content":"Programs are designed using common building blocks. These building blocks, known as programming constructs (or programming concepts), form the basis for all programs.\nThere are three basic building blocks to consider:\n sequence is the order in which instructions occur and are processed selection determines which path a program takes when it is running iteration is the repeated execution of a section of code when a program is running    Sequence    Sequence is the order in which programming statements are executed. Programming statements usually run one after another in order, unless one of the other programming constructs is used. The sequence of a program is extremely important as once these are translated, carrying out instructions in the wrong order leads to a program performing incorrectly.\nThe following example code will execute each line in order/sequence 1 2 3 4  print(\u0026#34;Let\u0026#39;s introduce ourselves.\u0026#34;) print(\u0026#34;My name is Eliza. What is your name?\u0026#34;) name = input() print(\u0026#34;Hello \u0026#34; + name + \u0026#34;, nice to meet you.\u0026#34;)  \nSelection    IF statements    Selection is a programming construct where a section of code is run only if a condition is met. In programming, there are often occasions when a decision needs to be made. Selection is the process of making a decision. The result of the decision can either be TRUE or FALSE, this determines which path the program will take next.\nThe following code uses selection to test the condition varHeight \u0026gt; 1.6, if this condition is TRUE then \u0026ldquo;Tall enough to enter ride\u0026rdquo; is printed. 1 2  if varHeight \u0026gt; 1.6: \tprint(\u0026#34;Tall enough to enter ride\u0026#34;)  \nThe following code uses selection to test the condition username == \u0026ldquo;Callum\u0026rdquo;, if this condition is TRUE then \u0026ldquo;Access granted\u0026rdquo; is printed. If the condition is FASLE we can use else: to execute a different line of code. 1 2 3 4  if username == \u0026#34;Callum\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Access granted\u0026#34;) else: \tprint(\u0026#34;Unknown username\u0026#34;)  \nIteration or Loop    Programs often need to repeat certain steps while or until a condition has been met. This process is known as iteration.\nIteration or repetition is often referred to as looping, since the program ‘loops’ back to an earlier line of code.\nIteration allows programmers to simplify a program and make it more efficient. Instead of writing out the same lines of code again and again(mistages happen), a programmer can write a section of code once, and ask the program to execute the same line repeatedly until no longer needed.\n"},{"id":20,"href":"/dit11/gameDesign/03walkthroughs/verticalShooter/","title":"Vertical shooter","parent":"Walk-throughs","content":" Twin Bee  "},{"id":21,"href":"/dit11/glossary/","title":"Glossary","parent":"11 DigiTech","content":""},{"id":22,"href":"/dit11/gameDesign/03walkthroughs/moreTutorials/","title":"More walk-throughs","parent":"Walk-throughs","content":"Simple Game Tutorials for Python and Pygame Zero 1.2\n"},{"id":23,"href":"/dit11/gameDesign/inspiration/","title":"Inspiration","parent":"Game Design","content":"Here is a selection of games which are over 30 years old, but which show that well thought out gameplay doesn\u0026rsquo;t need graphics to shine.\nMaybe one of these will inspire your next creation\u0026hellip;\n"},{"id":24,"href":"/dit11/troubleshooting/","title":"Troubleshooting","parent":"11 DigiTech","content":""},{"id":25,"href":"/dit11/reference/","title":"Reference materials","parent":"11 DigiTech","content":"Robotics     LEGO MicroPython Documentation LEGO Python for EV3 EV3 Tutorial  Game Design     Pygame Zero documentation Physics for Game Developers Teaching a kid to code with Pygame Zero  "},{"id":26,"href":"/dit11/teaching/","title":"Teaching materials","parent":"11 DigiTech","content":""},{"id":27,"href":"/dit11/","title":"11 DigiTech","parent":"","content":"Welcome to Year 11 Digital Technologies!\nThis semester we will work on two broad topics:\n App development in Kivy using Python game design using Unity   Kivy   "},{"id":28,"href":"/dit11/glossary/argument/","title":"argument","parent":"Glossary","content":"When calling a function, the values given to it are called arguments.
